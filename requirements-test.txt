# With the release of version 2.10, Ansible finally correctly
# identifies Kali Linux as being the Kali distribution of the Debian
# OS family.  This simplifies a lot of things for roles that support
# Kali Linux, so it makes sense to force the installation of Ansible
# 2.10 or newer.
#
# We need at least version 6 to correctly identify Amazon Linux 2023
# as using the dnf package manager.

# This package currently has a bug that causes Molecule to fail.  See
